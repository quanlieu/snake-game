# snake-game
A simple snake game I make during my free time.
Nothing special here, just run the index.html or visit [demo](https://quanlieu.github.io/snake-game/). Use the arrow key to control the snake.

## TODO
- Prevent food from spawning on snake occupied cell
- Refactor code
- Polish the game to make it feel "finished"
